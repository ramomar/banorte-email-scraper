A library for scraping transaction emails from Banorte.

## Scrapers
The library includes 18 scrapers collected from different types of emails collected over 1 year period.

You can take a look [here](https://github.com/ramomar/banorte-email-scraper/tree/master/test/emails) in order to see which emails have an scraper implemented already.

*The parsing of the dates is up to you due to the weird formats Banorte uses. In my opinion those dates are not very accurate. I recommend taking a look at the timestamp of the email when it arrived in your inbox, and then comparing the two dates in order to see which one is better for your use case.*

## Usage
1. Install the package.
```sh
npm install --save git+ssh://git@github.com/ramomar/banorte-email-scraper.git
```

2. Require the scraper and use it!
```js
const fs = require('fs');
const scrapeBanorteEmail = require('banorte-email-scraper');

const htmlInBase64 = fs.readFileSync('./banorte-email-in-base-64');
const html = Buffer.from(htmlInBase64, 'base64').toString();

console.log(scrapeBanorteEmail(html));
```
